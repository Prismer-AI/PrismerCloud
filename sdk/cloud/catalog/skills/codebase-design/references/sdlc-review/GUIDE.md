# SDLC Review Skill

Independently verify a handed-off deliverable against its original acceptance
criteria. This is a supporting method for codebase-design, not a Kanban worker
entry. Read the actual task specification, handoff and prior findings through
available tools. No upstream kanban_* tools, environment flags or automatic
complete/block transitions are authorized by this guide.

## Verdict contract

Return one review verdict: approve, request_changes, or needs_decision. Each
must include criterion-to-evidence mappings, exact checks and unresolved gaps.
This is a report, not a mutation of task lifecycle. Only the task owner and the
platform's real authorization/state protocol may transition a task.

## Review Lenses

Vary how you look at the work on each round instead of repeating the same inspection. Decorrelated lenses catch different defect classes: a cold read of the artifact surfaces design and correctness problems that the implementer's narrative would have framed away, execution surfaces claims that do not reproduce, and a strict contract audit surfaces quiet scope drift. Repeating the round-1 lens on round 3 mostly re-finds what round 1 already found.

Determine the current round from the history the task record already gives you: count the `changes_requested` entries in the "Prior attempts on this task" section of your worker context (also visible as prior runs in the task record). The current review round is that count plus one. Round 1 therefore shows zero `changes_requested` attempts; round 2 shows one; and so on.

| Round | Lens | How to apply it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Artifact | Read the diff or deliverable cold, before the implementer's summary. Form an independent judgment, then compare it against the handoff narrative and investigate every mismatch. |
| 2 | Execution | Check out the work and actually run it via `terminal`: build, test, and exercise the reported behavior yourself. Verify each handoff claim empirically instead of re-reading the artifact. |
| 3+ | Contract | Re-read the ORIGINAL task body and acceptance criteria, then audit the deliverable strictly against them. Also verify that every item from every prior `requested-changes verdict` round actually landed. |

The baseline duties in the Procedure section still apply on every round; the lens sets which inspection you lead with and weight most heavily.

### Lens variation for ad-hoc review fan-outs

The same principle applies outside the Kanban review lane. When spawning multiple parallel reviewers via `delegate_task`, give each reviewer a different lens — one diff-only brief, one full-context brief, one checkout-and-run brief — rather than identical briefs. Identical briefs produce correlated verdicts and duplicate findings; varied briefs cover more defect classes for the same review spend.

## Procedure

### 1. Orient from the durable task record

Read the task record and identify:

- the original task body and acceptance criteria;
- the latest implementation summary and structured metadata;
- changed files, commit identifiers, and test evidence;
- comments and decisions from earlier runs;
- findings from prior review rounds.

Treat the handoff as a claim to verify, not as proof that the work is correct.

### 2. Compare requested behavior with delivered behavior

Map every acceptance criterion to concrete implementation or output evidence. Note omissions, changed semantics, and unrelated scope before deciding whether to run deeper checks.

For code work:

1. Use `read_file` and `search_files` to inspect the changed paths and their callers.
2. Use `terminal` to inspect the diff and run the project's existing focused tests, lint, type checks, or build commands.
3. Exercise the reported failure path and at least one ordinary control path when practical.
4. Check error handling, edge cases, concurrency boundaries, data preservation, security boundaries, and cross-platform behavior relevant to the change.
5. Confirm that tests assert behavior rather than merely snapshotting source text or constants.

For non-code work:

1. Inspect the complete deliverable rather than only its summary.
2. Check correctness, completeness, formatting, and provenance.
3. Validate referenced URLs or external facts with the appropriate native tools when they affect the verdict.

### 3. Choose one verdict

#### Approve

Approve only when the acceptance criteria are satisfied and the evidence is sufficient. Call:

```json
{"verdict":"approve","checks":[],"evidence":[],"limitations":[]}
```

Populate every evidence/check field with actual results; an empty example is not approval.
Include the exact checks that passed and any bounded caveat that does not block acceptance.

#### Request changes

Use this for specific, correctable defects. First record actionable findings:

```json
{"verdict":"request_changes","findings":[{"path":"file:line","reproduction":"...","required_outcome":"..."}]}
```

Then return the same task to its implementer:

Record this verdict for the original implementer; do not change task state.

State where the defect is, how it reproduces, why it violates the task, and what minimum outcome would resolve it. The transition does not use blocker recurrence accounting.

#### Escalate

Use escalation only when the reviewer and implementer cannot resolve the problem without a human decision or external prerequisite:

```json
{"verdict":"needs_decision","reason":"...","required_input":"..."}
```

Explain the blocked decision and the smallest information needed to continue.

### 4. Preserve role separation

Do not edit the implementation while acting as reviewer. Request changes and let the implementer produce the next candidate; then independently verify that candidate in the next review run.

## Pitfalls

- **Rubber-stamping:** A passing handoff summary is not independent evidence.
- **Reviewer implementation:** Editing the deliverable hides ownership and weakens the re-review boundary.
- **Vague findings:** “Needs work” does not give the implementer a reproducible correction target.
- **Style-only blocking:** Do not request changes for preference-level nits when behavior and repository standards are satisfied.
- **Skipping prior rounds:** Re-review must confirm both the requested corrections and preservation of previously passing behavior.
- **Using blockers for ordinary rework:** Correctable defects belong in `requested-changes verdict`; reserve `needs-decision verdict` for genuine external blockers or human decisions.
- **Completing without evidence:** Every approval summary must name the checks or artifacts actually inspected.

## Verification

Before submitting the verdict, confirm:

- [ ] The task record was read for the current task and run.
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion was mapped to evidence.
- [ ] The actual deliverable was inspected.
- [ ] Relevant focused checks were run or an explicit reason was recorded when execution was impossible.
- [ ] Prior requested changes were re-tested on re-review.
- [ ] Unrelated regressions and scope changes were considered.
- [ ] The report contains exactly one verdict and no unauthorized lifecycle transition.
- [ ] The summary contains concrete, non-secret evidence.
- [ ] No implementation files were edited by the reviewer.
